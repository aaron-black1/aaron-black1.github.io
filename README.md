# About Me
## My Interests
- I enjoy playing games and watching football. I like most kinds of games, but some of my favorites would be The Legend of Zelda series, Pokemon, World of Warcraft, and the Elder Scroll Series. My football team is the Washington Commanders.
## Websites I recommend
- [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) - I really enjoy listening to audiobooks, wether its one if heard before like Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings or a new one.
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) - Reddit is great for everything but mostly for wasting time. Its a good tool to learn new information, though you shouldn't believe everything you read on it.
